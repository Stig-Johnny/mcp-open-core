# MCP Open Core — Sovereign-Class Quant Intelligence Platform

Welcome to MCP Open Core — the public, open-source foundation of the institutional-grade MCP Sovereign Fusion System.

This repository contains a modular scaffold replicating the core logic architecture of MCP v1.0 and Quantum Apex v2.0, designed for educational, research, and private fund exploration purposes.
