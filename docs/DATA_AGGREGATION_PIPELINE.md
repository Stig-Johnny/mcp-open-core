# MCP SOVEREIGN — DATA AGGREGATION PIPELINE

---

🚀 MCP Quantum Apex — Sovereign Market Signal Aggregation Layer

This document explains the internal data pipeline that ingests, normalizes, and supplies market data into the fusion system.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

- Pull real-time multi-source market signals.
- Normalize diverse inputs into unified fusion score signals.
- Prepare adaptive data feeds for fusion computation.

---

## 🔧 MODULE LOCATION

`/fusion/data_aggregator.py`

---

## 🔄 DATA INGESTION SOURCES

| Source Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Price Feeds | BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, UNI, FET, RNDR, DOGE, PEPE |
| Sentiment Feeds | Twitter, News, TradingView Indicators |
| Whale Activity | Exchange inflows/outflows, Whale Alerts |
| Liquidity Metrics | Stablecoin inflows/outflows |
| Volatility Index | Internal MCP calculated VIX |
| Macro Inputs | USD index, treasury yields, geopolitical risk indexes |

---

## 🔧 SAMPLE FETCH STRUCTURE

```python
def fetch_signals(self):
    signals = {}
    signals['price'] = self.fetch_price_data()
    signals['sentiment'] = self.fetch_sentiment_index()
    signals['whales'] = self.fetch_whale_flows()
    signals['liquidity'] = self.fetch_liquidity_data()
    signals['volatility'] = self.compute_internal_vix()
    signals['macro_bias'] = self.compute_macro_signal()
    return signals
```

---

## 📊 NORMALIZATION PROCESS

- Each signal normalized between [-1, 1]
- Historical percentile scaling applied for stability
- Outlier smoothing to avoid reaction to false spikes

---

## 🔐 FAILSAFE PROTOCOLS

| Layer | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Data Inconsistency | Use last-known-good signal |
| API Failure | Auto-backoff and retry logic |
| Extreme Volatility | Temporary signal dampening |
| Whale Spike Handling | Threshold-smoothing dampener |

---

## 🔬 RECURSIVE DATA INTEGRATION

- All normalized signals directly feed into fusion scoring (fusion_node.py).
- Calibration bias applied post-aggregation.
- Reinforcement bias applied after calibration.

---

## 🚦 DATA INTEGRITY MONITOR

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Normal | All live feeds operational |
| Partial | One or more feeds fallback to cache |
| Degraded | Multiple sources unavailable |
| Kill Trigger | Fusion disabled if data unavailable |

---

## 🔭 FUTURE EXTENSION (v2.0+)

- AI Anomaly Detection on Data Streams
- Whale Cluster Anticipation Layer
- Real-Time Stablecoin Velocity Modeling
- Dynamic Source Weight Adjustments
