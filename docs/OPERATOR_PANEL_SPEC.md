üöÄ MCP Quantum Apex ‚Äî Sovereign Operator Control Room

This document defines the internal sovereign control interface used by the fund operator to manage and observe live MCP execution.

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

- Allow direct human oversight without compromising sovereign recursive logic.
- Enable sovereign bias adjustments.
- Monitor live fusion scores, posture, reinforcement, and kill-switch states.
- Provide secure system status reporting.

## üñ• PANEL FUNCTIONS

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Live Fusion Score Display

- Continuously fetches latest fusion score and posture.

```python
self.status_console.fetch_fusion_score()
```

- Visual output:

```
Fusion Score: +0.57
Posture: MODERATE BULL
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Calibration Bias Adjustment

- Sovereign operator can adjust calibration live:

```python
self.calibration_engine.adjust_bias(delta)
```

- Allows temporary manual override of model sensitivity.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Model Display

- Displays current reinforcement sensitivity state:

```
Reinforcement Bias: 0.42
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Kill-Switch Status Monitor

- Displays active kill-switch state:

```
Kill Switch Status: ARMED / DISARMED
```

- Operator is notified of any defense triggers in real-time.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Sovereign Logs & System Health

- Live system heartbeat monitor confirms:

```
System Status: OPERATIONAL
Last Update: Timestamped
API Heartbeat: ALIVE
Fusion Node: SYNCED
Reinforcement Model: ACTIVE
```
