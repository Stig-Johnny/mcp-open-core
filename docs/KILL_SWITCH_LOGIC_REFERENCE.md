# MCP SOVEREIGN â€” KILL SWITCH LOGIC REFERENCE

---

ğŸš€ MCP Quantum Apex â€” Capital Defense Protocol

This document explains the internal design of the kill switch system that protects capital during extreme adverse conditions.

---

## ğŸ”’ OBJECTIVE

- Halt trading and execution immediately under defined catastrophic risk signals.
- Prevent overexposure during:
  - Fusion score breakdowns
  - Sentiment collapse
  - Liquidity evaporations
  - Whale-driven flash crashes

---

## ğŸ”§ MODULE LOCATION

`/execution/kill_switch.py`

---

## âš  ACTIVATION TRIGGERS

The kill switch monitors several core fusion subsystems for real-time risk.

| Trigger Condition | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Fusion Breakdown | Fusion score variance exceeds safe boundaries |
| Reinforcement Divergence | Reinforcement vs Fusion score desynchronization |
| Sentiment Shock Spike | SIGMA-WAVE detects abnormal sentiment collapse |
| Whale Panic Flow | ORCA-X detects large whale unloading clusters |
| Liquidity Drain | LPI-360 signals sudden liquidity withdrawal |
| Sovereign Override | Manual kill switch activation by operator |

---

## ğŸ”„ EXAMPLE ACTIVATION LOGIC

```python
def check_kill_switch(self, fusion_score, sentiment, liquidity, whale_flow):
    if abs(fusion_score) > 1.5:
        return True
    if sentiment < -0.9:
        return True
    if liquidity < -0.8:
        return True
    if whale_flow <= -3.0:
        return True
    return False
```

*Actual live version is more complex, multi-signal weighted and recursive.*

---

## ğŸ›¡ DEFENSE MODES

| Mode | Action |
|------|--------|
| Soft Pause | Stop new entries, allow graceful exits |
| Hard Stop | Halt all trading immediately |
| Lockdown | Freeze entire system state, operator review required |

---

## ğŸ§¬ FAILSAFE PROTOCOLS

- Sovereign log writes all activations to permanent audit logs.
- Operator notification system activates during any kill event.
- Reinforcement learning suspended during lock.

---

## ğŸ”­ FUTURE EXTENSION (v2.0+)

- AI Risk Cluster Correlation Layers
- Predictive Kill Threshold Adjustments
- Dynamic Kill Ladder Scaling
