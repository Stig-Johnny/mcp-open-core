# MCP SOVEREIGN — FUSION ARCHITECTURE MAP

🚀 MCP Quantum Apex — Sovereign Fusion Intelligence Engine

This document explains the internal architecture of MCP's sovereign multi-layer fusion model, reinforcement loops, and adaptive signal processing.

---

## 🔬 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

MCP uses a recursive, multi-dimensional fusion framework to combine raw signals into actionable posture decisions.

**Core Layers:**
1️⃣ Raw Signal Aggregation  
2️⃣ Reinforcement & Calibration Bias  
3️⃣ Fusion Scoring Computation  
4️⃣ Posture Decision Logic  
5️⃣ Execution Routing & Kill-Switch

## ⚙ SIGNAL CATEGORIES

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| sentiment | Market sentiment level [-1, 1] |
| liquidity | Liquidity flow [-1, 1] |
| whales | Net whale inflows/outflows (numeric delta) |
| macro_bias | Global risk posture [-1, 0, 1] |
| sector_bias | Current favored sector weighting |
| narrative_acceleration | Emerging narrative momentum |
| liquidity_shock | Flash liquidity drain triggers |
| whale_cluster | Whale cluster balance state |
| meta_sentiment | Smoothed long-term sentiment |
| meta_sentiment_spread | Sentiment dispersion |
| sentinel_spike | Volatility shock monitor |

---

## 🧠 REINFORCEMENT ADAPTATION

- **reinforcement_model.py** analyzes fusion outcomes and adjusts sensitivity bias recursively.  
- This allows MCP to learn market state shifts over time automatically.

---

## 🧮 CALIBRATION ADAPTATION

- **calibration_engine.py** provides sovereign operator manual bias override control for tactical tuning.

---

## 🚦 POSTURE DECISION TREE

| Fusion Score | Posture |
|--------------|---------|
| >= 0.7 | BULLISH |
| >= 0.3 | MODERATE BULL |
| >= 0.0 | NEUTRAL |
| >= -0.3 | MODERATE BEAR |
| < -0.3 | BEARISH |

*Thresholds can be updated as reinforcement evolves.*

---

## 🔐 KILL SWITCH PROTOCOL

- If extreme fusion score anomalies emerge or signals conflict strongly, kill_switch.py is activated to halt execution for safety.

---

## 🔭 FUTURE EXTENSIONS (v2.0+)

- Liquidity Forecast Model (LPI-360)
- Whale Predictive Flow Model (ORCA-X)
- AI Narrative Acceleration Model (SIGMA-WAVE)
- Sector Rotational Adaptive Weights
