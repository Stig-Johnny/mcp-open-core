# MCP SOVEREIGN — PROFIT LADDER PROTOCOL

---

🚀 MCP Quantum Apex — Recursive Profit Management Engine

This document explains the internal logic of the profit ladder system, which systematically locks in gains as favorable price action occurs while maintaining exposure during expansions.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

- Lock profits incrementally as price advances.
- Allow adaptive exposure scaling.
- Balance profit capture with trend continuation.
- Function recursively with reinforcement & fusion scoring.

---

## 🔧 MODULE LOCATION

`/execution/profit_ladder.py`

---

## 🛠 CORE STRATEGY

The profit ladder maintains dynamic tiered price targets:

- Entry Zone: Fusion score triggers initial positions.
- Ladder Zones: Auto-generated profit tiers based on:
  - ATR (Average True Range)
  - Historical volatility
  - Current fusion score momentum

---

## 🔄 LADDER GENERATION EXAMPLE

```python
def generate_profit_ladder(self, entry_price, volatility):
    tiers = []
    base_step = entry_price * (volatility * 0.02)
    for i in range(1, 6):
        tiers.append(entry_price + i * base_step)
    return tiers
```

- Ladder expands or contracts based on volatility regime.
- Higher volatility → wider ladder steps.

---

## 💰 PROFIT EXECUTION LOGIC

```python
def check_profit_take(self, current_price, ladder_levels):
    for level in ladder_levels:
        if current_price >= level and not self.taken_levels[level]:
            self.execute_take(level)
            self.taken_levels[level] = True
```

- Prevents multiple triggers at same level.
- Executes partial exits at each ascending ladder.
